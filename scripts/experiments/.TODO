When running python injector, it will additionally create a unique identifier that is assigned to the application and stored in the HTML script

.NET web apps use `.cshtml` files! üî•

  -  research more html templating extensions => find out if other common frameworks use different extensions for their html files.

Add support for WordPress ??? ‚ùì

  - write a plugin that injects scripts automatically. Not hard. It will be a separate component, independent from the injector: 

      - a php file with the plugin
      - the script as a JS file
      - a json file that the developer will have to set manually, and the js will refer to
